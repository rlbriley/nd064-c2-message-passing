The following small python program that is included as writer.py in the modules
connections-grpc directory can be used to generate a test gRPC message for the
connections-grpc container. You can access the provided writer.py once the
pod is up and running by opening a shell into the container with:

kubectl exec --stdin --tty <Name of grpc-connections pod> -- /bin/sh

Then executing: python3 writer.py



import grpc
import connections_pb2
import connections_pb2_grpc

"""
Sample implementation of a writer that can be used to write messages to gRPC.

print("Sending sample payload...")

channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:5005")
stub = connections_pb2_grpc.ConnectionsServiceStub(channel)

# Update this with desired payload
item = connections_pb2.ConnectionQuery(
    person=5,
    start_date="2020-01-01",
    end_date="2020-12-30",
    distance=5
)


response = stub.person_contacts(item)
